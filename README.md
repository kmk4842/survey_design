# Survey design methods with python
Here is some data and code to help with learning how to design surveys. The original survey was administered at Lodz University of Technology in 2023. Read more about it in the jupyter notebook. 

## Survey questions
1. Asks for overall rating of accesibility using a numbered scale.
2. Asks for a rating on 7 elements using categories as scale (because respondents may not consider all elements when doing the overall rating and they may have various scales in mind).
3. Asks for a rating on 12 elements of accessible bathroom design (based on technical requirements for accessible bathrooms).
